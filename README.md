# House price prediction
House price prediction involves analyzing various factors such as location, property size, condition, and market trends. Machine learning algorithms like regression, decision trees, or neural networks can be used to make predictions based on historical data. To create a house price prediction model, you'll need a dataset with relevant features and target values (actual prices) for training and testing the model. Keep in mind that the accuracy of predictions can vary depending on the quality and quantity of data, as well as the chosen algorithm.
